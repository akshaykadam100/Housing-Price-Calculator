#### Building Type varibale do not hold any order. So, this variable can be used as Categorical Nominal Variable

#### Being a categorical ordinal variable, following values will be imputed

#### This variable can be considered as categorical ordinal variable

#### From the above correlation value, we can somehow be clear that Lot Frontage Size somehow impact price of the house
#### From the above correlation value, we can somehow be clear that Lot Shape somehow impact price of the house, although in negative way

#### Correlation Co-efficient of Sale Price with this variable is not strong enough.

#### For the Street Column, more than 99% of values ares same. We can say that this column will not have enough predictive power
#### Owing to this, we can drop this column

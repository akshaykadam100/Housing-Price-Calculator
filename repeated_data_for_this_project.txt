#### XXXXX variable do not hold any order. So, this variable can be used as Categorical Nominal Variable

#### Being a categorical ordinal variable, following values will be imputed
#### This variable can be considered as categorical ordinal variable

#### This variable can be considered as continuous variable


#### None values are imputed as -1, because data dictionary states that null value corresponds to no fireplace due to which this value is not applicable. Therefore isntead of imputing 0, we will impute -1


#### For the XXXXX Column, more than 99% of values ares same. We can say that this column will not have enough predictive power
#### Owing to this, we can drop this column


#### In the above variable there are 5 unique values of which last three are very scarce . We can avoid creating dummy variable for these variables, as it will result in many columns which will increase complexity and dimesnionality of the model.
#### For this, we will encode only top 2 values and map all other values as Others

#### From the above correlation value, we can somehow be clear that XXXXX somehow impact price of the house
#### From the above correlation value, we can somehow be clear that XXXXX somehow impact price of the house, although in negative way
#### From the above correlation value, we can be clear that XXXXX impacts price of the house significantly
#### Correlation Co-efficient of Sale Price with this variable is not strong enough.

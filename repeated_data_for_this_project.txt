#### XXXXX variable do not hold any order. So, this variable can be used as Categorical Nominal Variable

#### Being a categorical ordinal variable, following values will be imputed
#### This variable can be considered as categorical ordinal variable

#### This variable can be considered as continuous variable



#### For the XXXXX Column, more than 99% of values ares same. We can say that this column will not have enough predictive power
#### Owing to this, we can drop this column


#### In the above variable there are more than 25 unique values. If we create dummy variable for each of this, it will result in many columns which will increase complexity and dimesnionality of the model.
#### For this, we will encode only top 10 values and map all other values to 0


plot_bar_graph_from_series(data=raw_data.groupby(by='AAAAAAAA').SalePrice.mean() / 1000,
                           plot_title='AAAAAAAA Vs Average Sale Price', x_axis_label='AAAAAAAA',
                           y_axis_label='Average Sale Price (In Thousands)', data_label_rotation='horizontal')
						   
plot_reg_graph_from_series(x_data=raw_data.AAAAAAAA, y_data=raw_data.SalePrice, plot_title='AAAAAAAA Vs. Sale Price',
                           x_axis_label='AAAAAAAA', y_axis_label='Sale Price')
						   

print('Pearsons Correlation: %.2f' % np.corrcoef(raw_data.AAAAAAAA, raw_data.SalePrice)[0,1])

#### From the above correlation value, we can somehow be clear that XXXXX somehow impact price of the house
#### From the above correlation value, we can somehow be clear that XXXXX somehow impact price of the house, although in negative way
#### From the above correlation value, we can be clear that XXXXX impacts price of the house significantly
#### Correlation Co-efficient of Sale Price with this variable is not strong enough.
